# my-lists-js-portfolio-project
My lists is a list-based website management system (for future developement: tagging and search functionality).
A user can add new Lists and assign websites to those lists.
A user can delete a website and a list when the list is empty.
A list name or website cannot be blank and a list has to be assigned to a website when adding websites to a list.
